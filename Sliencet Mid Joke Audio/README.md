This folder contains recordings of each joke being told without an audience so there is never laughter or other sounds mixed in with the robot's delivery in case such audio is needed for doing comparisons in detecting mid-joke laughter or for other analysis.

`joke_list.txt` matches the file names to the names of the joke that each plays in the following format:

*name of joke* **:** *file name*
