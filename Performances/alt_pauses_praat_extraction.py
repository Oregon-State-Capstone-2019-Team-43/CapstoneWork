# Program for running the extract_mid_joke.praat or extract_post_joke.praat scripts on multiple performance directories
# Requires Python 3.5 or later

# This script assumes it is run in the directory containing the various performance folders
# and the joke and pause audio files are in a "jokes_and_pauses" subdirectory within each performance folder.
# It is designed to be run on a Windows computer, differences in file path format on another OS may cause errors.
# Praat.exe should be located in the directory this script is run from.
