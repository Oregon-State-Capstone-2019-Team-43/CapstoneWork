# Differences Between Machine Learning Set Joke Audio and Raw Joke Audio

Some performances in the machine learning set contain fewer jokes than the raw joke audio files. I explain these differences below.

## Robot Name Joke

The robot tells a single joke in two parts:
* "Hello, I'm John."
* "Of course, that is not my real name, but humans always have trouble pronouncing [dial-up noises]"

The first part is not technically a joke, and does not typically garner laughs.

In the raw joke audio files, this joke is sometimes divided in two. This occurs in the following performances:

*	2018-08-22 Riverside Getaway Cafe
* 2018-08-23 Caffeine and Cackles
* 2018-08-24 808 House Party
*	2018-08-25 Flappers Showcase

The machine learning set standardizes on a single joke file, so all performances that contained this joke in two parts now appear to have one fewer joke.

## Happy Birthday Taylor

One of the robot's performances was a special birthday party show (2018-07-26 Surprise Party). It told a custom joke for this show where it wished someone happy birthday (`joke_12.mp3` in the raw data). This joke has been removed from the data set, reducing this performance's joke count by 1.
