# Mid-Joke Rating Criteria

_This is still a work in progress._

1. Laughter must take place with no more than a 1 second pause between the robot speaking
2. Laughter must be clearly heard (i.e. explosive laughter. No quiet chuckles)
3. Laughter does not occur right before the end of a joke (approx 2-3 seconds)
4. Laughter right at the beginning of a joke (file) do not count
